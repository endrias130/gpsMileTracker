## Abstract
This is an Android app that can track mileage traveled and time elapsed for the user.
The app needs user permission for tracking the coordinates and getting the location of the user.
It can then display the realtime location and mileage traveled for that user.
## Technologies
We use GitHub as the version management, and code storage.
The app is implemented using Android Studio as the IDE with simulations.
We also use the FusedLocationProviderClient for getting the map and the coordinates.
## License
This is an open-source and no license is needed to use the app. Feel free to contribute by pull request and make the app more functioning.
